## General info

Blucifinder is an application built with react. Tested with Jest and @testing-library/react. This project was created as a paired programming exercise in Front End Engineering Module 3 at _Turing School of Software and Design_ This project demonstrates a comprehension of __TDD__ _test driven development_, __object oriented programming__, and  __data structure__ as well as DOM creation around the consumed data.

## Learning Goals

* Test Driven development
* Object Oriented Programming
* DRY and Re-useable Code
* Async testing
* React
* React testing

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project repository (repo) on GitHub (https://github.com/lmanriq/vrad-app). Then, click the __green__ button that reads _'clone or download'_.
2. Navigate to the CLI (Terminal) on your machine and enter: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]` â€“ replace what is in the [] with the cloned URL and whatever you would like to call the repo.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).
5. Navigate to the api repository (repo) on GitHub (https://github.com/turingschool/VRAD-API). Then, click the __green__ button that reads _'clone or download'_.
6. repeat steps 3 and 4
